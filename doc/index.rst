Summary
=============

Rpxdock (as well as the ambitious vaporware scheme, and the conceptually related rifdock) is a multi-scale model of protein structure suited to global search of conformation space. rpxdock utilizes a novel transform-based objective function which [[Projects:rpxdock:Scoring#Accuracy|retains some of the power of fullatom force-fields]], while avoiding a costly and difficult-to-optimize fullatom model. The rpxdock model is carefully crafted to allow both [[Projects:rpxdock:Pair Decomposition|pair]] and [[Projects:rpxdock:Hierarchical Grid|hierarchical]] decomposition of all underlying DOFs, opening the door to [[Projects:rpxdock:Pair Decomposition#Hierarchical Packing| new optimization techniques]]. Early prototypes of rpxdock are currently in use in the baker lab, and [[Projects:rpxdock#Applications|generally perform well]].
